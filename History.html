                    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Chancellor Hall was 
                      named in honour of the first Chancellor of the University, 
                      Her Royal Highness Princess Alice - Countess of Athlone, 
                      and was opened to University students in 1953.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Since then the Chancellor 
                      of the University has also been recognised as the patron 
                      of the Hall. It is as a result if this (royal) connection 
                      that the gentlemen of Chancellor Hall were able to have 
                      tea with Her Royal Highness on an annual basis.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Although University 
                      students lived in Chancellor Hall from 1953, Chancellor 
                      did not become an official Hall of residence until September 
                      1954. In fact, from as early as 1952 student nurses, staff 
                      nurses and nursing sisters of the University College Hospital 
                      of the West Indies resided in the buildings of Chancellor.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Unofficially, Chancellor 
                      Hall began in 1953 when 35 residents (students) of Gibraltar 
                      Hall succumbed to official pressure and moved over to Chancellor. 
                      These students - Gibraltarites - were previously housed 
                      in a group of huts which were occupied by refugees during 
                      the war years. These huts were collectively known as Gibraltar(Gib) 
                      Hall and were located on Gibraltar Road.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">So the men moved 
                      to the new hall taking with them their own ways and experiences 
                      which grew and expanded into the Spirit - the very essence 
                      of Chancellor Hall. They also brought with them the mementos 
                      of the merry days on the plain, that is the Bell of Gibraltar. 
                      It is difficult to describe the loyalty which this cracked 
                      and battered relic inspired except that one perceives that 
                      the whole Spirit of Chancellor was symbolized therein.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Gibraltar was truly 
                      embryonic Chancellor. So much so that the last Chairman 
                      of Gib, Kenneth Standard (now Professor Sir Kenneth Standard), 
                      was asked to be the first Chairman of Chancellor in 1954. 
                      The Last Warden of Gib, Dr. Francis &quot;Bobo&quot; Bowen, 
                      was also asked to be the first Warden but due to personal 
                      reasons he refused. The distinction is held by Professor 
                      Leslie Robinson, presently Lecturer in the Math department 
                      and former Principal here at the University of the West 
                      Indies Mona. &quot;Bobo&quot; eventually served as Warden 
                      of Chancellor from 1958-67.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">The true lions settled 
                      in and found to their amazement, that the new environs were 
                      very much to their liking and conducive to the true spirit 
                      of brotherhood and camaraderie which was so much a part 
                      of the Gib. Such was the surge of the enthusiasm that the 
                      gentlemen of Chancellor Hall decided that this magnificent 
                      spirit should be immortalized, and, to this end selected 
                      the colours - the brave black and gold.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">The Bell remained 
                      the symbol of Lions hope and pride, a remembrance of the 
                      ember from which the fire of Chancellor arose, combined 
                      with all this was an implied vow for excellence, a desire 
                      to succeed and to be the best.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">The block provided 
                      ready focal points for a vigorous interplay of competition 
                      which kept he Lions' skills in the arena of sports at a 
                      peak. Through the early years and into the mid sixties, 
                      Chancellor flourished; indeed Chancellorites dominated practically 
                      every field of activity in sports and academics. The Lions 
                      Tolled and basked in the accolades which they felt were 
                      their due.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">With the Bell of 
                      Gibraltar, Chancellor Hall prospered Every football term 
                      the Bell would go the matches with the Lions and the struggle 
                      for its possession would he renewed. From the onset there 
                      had been intense debate as to who should have the Bell as 
                      a few Taylorites had also come from Gib Hall. As a result, 
                      the location of the Bell had to be changed periodically 
                      and a close guard kept over it.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Tragedy struck in 
                      1968 when the Bell was stolen from the Head Porter's Plat 
                      by a group of evildoers born the two places (Irvine and 
                      Taylor). The loss of the Bell &quot;rang' throughout the 
                      Hall. Since then the Lions have strived to find the Bell 
                      but to no avail. As Lions, we were all charged to investigate 
                      every niche and employ every device in the never-ending 
                      search for the Great Bell.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Under the leadership 
                      of Mr. Winston Wright (Warden) and Carl Brown (Hall Chairman 
                      '72-73) it was decided that there existed a need for a new 
                      symbol. The Lion was constructed and later christened &quot;Bobo&quot;, 
                      in honour of Dr. Francis Bowen, the third Warden of Chancellor 
                      Hall.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Mr. Wright, Warden 
                      1971-76, conscious of the history of the Hall implemented 
                      'Lions Week&quot; during which old Lions and outstanding 
                      present Lions would he honoured. Lions Week has since become 
                      a permanent feature of the Hall calendar.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">The Wardens have 
                      been an integral part of our history though information 
                      on many of their deeds have been lost through time Despite 
                      this loss, two things have been passed en through ST., - 
                      (small talk).</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">The Wardens participated 
                      in a great way to the building of this unique community. 
                      They helped to mould the first Chancellorites and nurtured 
                      the brave new spirit through the early formative years.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">The respect and love 
                      which these men inspired in the past Lions transcend time 
                      such that you too, will feel their influence.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Even today Freshmen 
                      are inducted in the name of Bobo, Brongo and Hart.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">While in the process 
                      of becoming a Lion you will hear about the exploits of former 
                      Lions, their prodigious for liquor, their unconventional 
                      nature and their Forages to the South. Becoming a Lion will 
                      mean involving yourself in the traditional and favoured 
                      recreations of the Lions. Thus you will learn to S.T. on 
                      any subject on earth till the wee hours of the morning, 
                      to play quadrangle football and to sing poo-songs. You will 
                      also learn to rally round the flag and &quot;Bobo&quot; 
                      and a protect the Siren Sisters of the South. One of the 
                      most important aspects of a Chancellorites's life is his 
                      relationship with the ladies of the South. During Orientation 
                      Week you will be given every opportunity to make their acquaintance.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">In sports we have 
                      the reputation of always doing our best. This has paid fine 
                      dividends as Chancellor Hall is the feared and respected 
                      contender in any inter-Hall competition. This attitude is 
                      also evident in academic and non-academic features of University 
                      life.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Chancellor Hall has 
                      the best academic record on campus. This does not mean that 
                      we are book beaters but that the &quot;Mans&quot;, by and 
                      large, have found a reasonable balance between work and 
                      play. It is important that you also find this balance.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">The changes that 
                      we, as a Hall, have passed through are staggering. Many 
                      of the traditional past-times of the Lions have vanished 
                      from Hall life. Gone are the high teas, gone are the days 
                      of bottle throwing, gone are some of the light hearted pranks 
                      which characterized the institution. However, what has not 
                      changed is the indefinable something called Chancellor Spirit.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFCC00">Lennox Pike, Hall 
                      Chairman 1959-60, once wrote, &quot;Chancellor is a Hall 
                      rich with traditions&quot;. It is to be noted that traditions 
                      can only be a dynamic entity if new ones are being created 
                      and old ones modified. Even though we look at the past with 
                      admiration, we should realize that we are part of a new 
                      tradition. We must not use the noble traditions as an excuse 
                      for stagnation but an impetus for innovative thought and 
                      action.</font></p>
